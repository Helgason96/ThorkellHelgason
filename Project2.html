										<h1>Project 2: Computer-aided design and cutting</h1>
									</header>
									<p>For Project 2, I was supposed to use a CAD software to build a parametric design of a pressfit construction kit. Then cut my design with a laser cutter and at the same time, document the process and upload my design files. I wanted to design something that I could actually use. My idea was a laptop stand to use in my bed, that could also be used as a breakfast in bed platform. I started by learning parametric design by watching a tutorial that was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE" target="_blank">linked</a> on the teachers website. After that I searched on google for inspiration and I found <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/855050679235862338/" target="_blank">this</a> simple but elegant desing on pinterest. It can be seen here below:
                                    <br />

                                    <img src="images/PinterestDesign.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur" style= "width: 13cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />

                                    I followed this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7riGolu7BpA" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to practise designing a laptop stand. I completed the tutorial and created this laptop stand here:
                                    <br />

                                        <img src="images/T%C3%B6lvustandur.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Then I decided to create another design that was more similar the design on pinterest.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/84182465_3011092532257393_3935548945018650624_n.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">

                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    I used these parameters to be able to change the design when I want.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Festing%206.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">

                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The original idea was to try out this design in a smaller scale and then scale it up to real size when we start <a href="Project%204.html" target="_blank">Project 4.</a>. Because I would like to create a real laptop stand that I could actually use.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    So in the beginning I created the legs. I created both of them at the same time and then set the distance between them to be the parameter,  LegWidth.

                                    <br />
                                    <img src="images/Hli%C3%B0arplata.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">

                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Then I created the top plate on top of the legs, and cut out the profile of the legs into the top plate. They are the horizontal cut lines in the image. I also cut the profile of the supports into the main plate and they are the small vertical cut lines at the end.
                                    <br />

                                    <img src="images/ToppPlata.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    After assembling those two units I created this support system:
                                    <br />
                                    <img src="images/Festing1.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">

                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The idea was to constrain the legs from bending so I created these guys:
                                    <br />
                                    <img src="images/Festing%204.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">

                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The profile of these supports were also cut into the top plate so they would fit. Then I created a simple 4x4 mm bar to prevent those supports from falling down:
                                    <br />
                                    <img src="images/Festing%205.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">   <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Those bars then slide between the two supports and constrain the support from falling down:
                                    <br />
                                    <img src="images/Festing%202.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    When everyting is put together the support system looks like this:
                                    <br />
                                        <img src="images/Festing1.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                     Then I went to my local Fablab to laser cut my design. However, when I arrived in Fablab I noticed that my design was uneccesarily large so I scaled my design down by decreasing my parameters and fixing all relevant sizes. Now that all the designs were ready, I created a sketch from every surface of my designs, and saved them as a dxf file. I went to Inkscape and open my dxf files, I adjusted document properties to landscape and 300x600 mm, put line thickness to 0.02 mm and line colour to red. I saved this document as a pdf so it looked like this:
                                     <br />
                                        <img src="images/InkScape.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    I opened file > print and then I adjusted the print properties of the laser cut printer to the desired settings for a 4 mm mdf material. Those settings were provided to us by the local Fablab staff. After adjusting the printer I put my mfd plate in the printer as started the cutting process:
                                    <br />
                                        <img src="images/LaserCut2.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    After everyting was cut out I assembled my design together so it looked like this:
                                    <br />
                                        <img src="images/Tilb%C3%BAi%C3%B0.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">

                                        <img src="images/SideView.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">

                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    </p>
