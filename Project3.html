										<h1>Project 3: 3D Scanning and printing</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In this project I was supposed to use a design software to make something that could not be made subtractively, and 3D print my design with the constraints of maximum 4 hour printing time and the material available was 100g material. I started this project my searching on Google for cool 3D objects. I searched: "ideas for 3d printing" and I went on this <a href="https://all3dp.com/1/useful-cool-things-3d-print-ideas-3d-printer-projects-stuff/" target="_blank">website</a> whose title was "50 Cool Things to 3D Print in January 2020". On this website I found this cool design of a pencil holder.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/Pennahaldari1.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/Pennahaldari2.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    I decided to use this design as an inspiration. I used Fusion360 as my design software. I started by creating a box as big as I wanted my pencil holder to be. Then I started editing the box.

                                           <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/1.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    I used the fillet command to round the edges and created a sketch on the side of the box as can be seen as the blue surface.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/2_2.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">


                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                        In the sketch I used the spline command to create a curvy line on the box and then I extruded the material out.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/3.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/5.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />

                                    Then I created a plane at an angle to be able to create a sketch on that plane. That way I could draw shapes at an angle with respect to my object.
                                        <br />

                                    <img src="images/Project3/6.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                    Then I drew shapes on that sketch and used the extrude command in Fusion360 to cut those shapes into my object. I extruded them as far in as about 5 mm from the bottom.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/7.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/8.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        Then I created more shapes into the same sketch as before.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/11.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        Then I decided to select every area of the sketch excpect the areas that I wanted to become my pencil holders.                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/12.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                        That way, when I extrude the area out of my object I create this kind of design.
                                        <img src="images/Project3/13.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                        I also wanted to add slots for usb ports so I googled the typical size of a usb 3.0 port and I found it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0" target="_blank">this</a> Wikipedia page. The width was given as 12 mm and the height as 4.5 mm. So I decided to create box shaped holes in the dimension of 15x7mm and I extruded those holes 30 mm into the object.
                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/14.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        Now I was happy with my design. The next thing I did was went on the teachers website and into the homepage of <a href="https://haflidiasg.github.io/VEL403G.github.io/3D.html" target="_blank">Project 3</a>. There I found a video made by Arnar, an assistant teacher in this class where he went over the basic steps of 3D printing in the application Ultimaker Cura. The video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJjTwOnMQkY&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>, but it is in Icelandic.  Now I noticed that I did not know how to export my fusion360 design into a format that is 3D printable and is compatable with Ultimaker Cura. So I went to youtube and found a 5 minute tutorial that showed me how to save my object as a stl file and how to edit its properties. The video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcqH7pc1CbA&t=134s" target="_blank">here</a>.
                                        <br />
                                         <br />

                                        Now I saved my pencil holder design as a stl file
                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/19.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 14cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />

                                        I imported the stl file into Ultimaker Cura simply by dragging the file into the application. I followed the instructions from Arnars video and set the printer up in those particular settings. When everything was ready I sliced my design to see how much material it used and the printing time.
                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/20.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 20cm; height: 10cm;">
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                        I noticed that I was using two much material and the printing time was way too long!! So I decided to cut out some material from my object.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/23.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/24.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        However the printing time was still too large! So I had to cut out even more material!
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/26.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/27.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/28.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        I made one last change to the design to make sure it was within the time constraints.
                                         <img src="images/Project3/29.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/30.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/31.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/32.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/33.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">

                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        However, now I realized that my pencil holder would most likely not be able to stand and was a bit too short. Thats why I made the penchil holders longer and I decided to create a support.
                                      <br />

                                        <img src="images/Project3/36.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                         <br />
                                        <br />
                                        I drew different shapes on these planes and used the loft command in Fusion to create a wierd looking object

                                        <img src="images/Project3/37.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/38.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                         <br />
                                        <br />
                                         I then created a plane tangent to the bottom plate and cut the object with that plane.
                                        <img src="images/Project3/39.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/40.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">

                                         <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Now my object is exactly 100g but the printing time is bit too long. However, since it is only a time constraint I got permission to do it.
                                        <br />
