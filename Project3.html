										<h1>Project 3: 3D Scanning and printing</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In this project I was supposed to use a design software to make something that could not be made subtractively, and 3D print my design with the constraints of maximum 4 hour printing time and the material available was 100g material. On top of that we were also supposed to try out 3D scanning. I started this project by searching on Google for cool 3D objects. I searched: "ideas for 3d printing" and I went on this <a href="https://all3dp.com/1/useful-cool-things-3d-print-ideas-3d-printer-projects-stuff/" target="_blank">website</a> whose title was "50 Cool Things to 3D Print in January 2020". On this website I found this cool design of a pencil holder.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/Pennahaldari1.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/Pennahaldari2.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    I decided to use this design as an inspiration. I used Fusion360 as my design software. I started by creating a box as big as I wanted my pencil holder to be. Then I started editing the box.

                                           <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/1.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    I used the fillet command to round the edges and created a sketch on the side of the box as can be seen as the blue surface.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/2_2.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">


                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                        In the sketch I used the spline command to create a curvy line on the box and then I extruded the material out.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/3.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/5.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />

                                    Then I created a plane at an angle to be able to create a sketch on that plane. That way I could draw shapes at an angle with respect to my object.
                                        <br />

                                    <img src="images/Project3/6.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                    Then I drew shapes on that sketch and used the extrude command in Fusion360 to cut those shapes into my object. I extruded them as far in as about 5 mm from the bottom.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/7.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/8.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        Then I created more shapes into the same sketch as before.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/11.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        Then I decided to select every area of the sketch excpect the areas that I wanted to become my pencil holders.                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/12.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                        That way, when I extrude the area into my object its cuts out the material selected. That created this kind of design.
                                        <img src="images/Project3/13.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                        I also wanted to add slots for usb ports so I googled the typical size of a usb 3.0 port and I found it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0" target="_blank">this</a> Wikipedia page. The width was given as 12 mm and the height as 4.5 mm. So I decided to create box shaped holes with the dimensions 15x7mm and I extruded those holes 30 mm into the object.
                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/14.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        Now I was happy with my design. The next thing I did was went on the teachers website and into the homepage of <a href="https://haflidiasg.github.io/VEL403G.github.io/3D.html" target="_blank">Project 3</a>. There I found a video made by Arnar, an assistant teacher in this class where he went over the basic steps of 3D printing in the application Ultimaker Cura. The video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJjTwOnMQkY&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>, but it is in Icelandic.  Now I noticed that I did not know how to export my fusion360 design into a format that is 3D printable and is compatable with Ultimaker Cura. So I went to youtube and found a 5 minute tutorial that showed me how to save my object as a stl file and how to edit its properties. The video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcqH7pc1CbA&t=134s" target="_blank">here</a>.
                                        <br />
                                         <br />

                                        Now I saved my pencil holder design as a stl file
                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/19.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 14cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />

                                        I imported the stl file into Ultimaker Cura simply by dragging the file into the application. I followed the instructions from Arnars video and set the printer up in those particular settings. When everything was ready I sliced my design to see how much material it used and the printing time.
                                         <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/20.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 20cm; height: 10cm;">
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                        I noticed that I was using two much material and the printing time was way too long!! So I decided to cut out some material from my object.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/23.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/24.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        However the printing time was still too large! So I had to cut out even more material!
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/26.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/27.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/28.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        I made one last change to the design to make sure it was within the time constraints.
                                         <img src="images/Project3/29.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/30.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/31.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/32.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/33.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">

                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        However, now I realized that my pencil holder would most likely not be able to stand and was a bit too short. Thats why I made the penchil holders longer and I decided to create a support.
                                      <br />

                                        <img src="images/Project3/36.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                         <br />
                                        <br />
                                        I drew different shapes on these planes and used the loft command in Fusion to create a weird looking object

                                        <img src="images/Project3/37.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/38.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                         <br />
                                        <br />
                                         I then created a plane tangent to the bottom plate and cut the object with that plane.
                                        <img src="images/Project3/39.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <img src="images/Project3/40.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 12cm;">

                                         <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Now my object was within the material limit but the printing time was a bit too long. However, since it is only a time constraint I got permission to do it.
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/41.JPG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 17cm; height: 12cm;">
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        I went to fablab and started 3D printing my pencil holder! 
                                        <br />
                                        <img src="images/Project3/42.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 12cm; height: 17cm;">

                                    I learned a lot from this exercise! I never really understood the how 3D printing works and I didn't now how to use it. But after this exercise I know how to create objects that I can design! It is really cool. I learned how to set the settings on the printer, and how to make sure the printer would succeed in printing the object. Arnar's video was really helpful. The problems I encountered were staying within the material and time constraints and in the beginning my object would not have been able to stand on it's own. I fixed the constraints with a repetitive material deduction. I fixed the standing problem with my funny looking supports!

                                    <h2>The 3D scanning</h2>
                                    One month later I decided to get going on the 3D scanning part of project 3. I began by figuring out what object I wanted to 3D scan. I googled what kind of objects would be nice to 3D scan and the results were objects that had a lot of detail and not too much surface area. I decided to use this viking to 3D scan.
                                    <br />
                                    
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/viking.jpg" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 14cm;">
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    I took 53 photos of this object in good lighting. I started by taking a front photo and then moving slowly around the object taking photos all along the way. Then I put them on my computer. Then I decided to figure out which 3D scanning software to use. I decided to use the software Regard3D because my good friend Aron recommended it and I also found nice reviews about it online. So I went to their <a href="https://www.regard3d.org/" target="_blank">website</a> and downloaded the software. On their webiste you can access a step by step tutorial. I used this tutorial as a guide. But below I will describe the steps I took. When the software was downloaded, I launched it. I pressed the white blank page at the top left corner. That way I created a new project.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/1.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    I named my project "Viking".
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/2.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    Then I pressed "Add picture set"
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/3.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    I selected all of the images I took of the object. Then I pressed compute matches.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/4.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    After that I pressed triangulate. That creates a point cloud. It is rather hard to figure out the object from the point cloud.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/5.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    Then you use the densification command. That creates a dense pointcloud and that makes out the object.
                                    The following dialog appears.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/7.png" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    I saw in the tutorial from Regard3D that for small projects, users should deselect "Use visibility information (CMVS) because CMVS tends to generously throw away pictures. I did that and this was the result.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/6.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    This is still only a point cloud. Next I wanted to generate a surface that connects most of these points. I selected the densification in the project tree and then I clicked on "Create Surface". The following dialog appears.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/10.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 14cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    It was suggested to first use colored vertices to see the result of the surface reconstruction. If the result is not satisfying, users can create another surface using textures. I used the recommended settings.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/9.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 14cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    After a short while I got the following result.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/8.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    I exported the resulting surface as a .ply file. Then I put the surface into ultimaker cura. The results were not good.
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/11.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    The surface on top of the viking as well as the bottom was a problem. At this moment I realized that I did not take any photos from a top view and perhabs from lower views. And I was pretty sure that the lighting was a problem. I had an idea to retry taking photos of the object with only a white background. And I wanted to try to take more photos.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    I took 174 photos of the Viking and now I also took photos from a top view and the results were much better! I took the exact same steps as I did previously. 
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/12.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/13.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/14.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/15.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 16cm; height: 10cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    However these black walls were becoming a problem from me. I could not put this file into a 3D printing software. So I decided to change some settings in the "create surface" step which is the last step. I also contacted my team member and assistant teacher Aron to get some help. He pointed out that by changing the "trim threshold" the program would trim out most of the boundaries because there werent as many matches there as on the object itself! And it worked great. I also found out that by increasing the depth I got a better resulting Viking. The details were much better.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/16.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 10cm; height: 14cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <img src="images/3DScanning/17.PNG" alt="Tölvustandur2" style= "width: 20cm; height: 14cm;">
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    If I would want to 3D print the Viking I would have to put this surface into a another software to get rid of the bubbles around the Viking, and after that it would be ready!
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <h3>Results</h3>
                                    I really liked how realistic the 3D scanned Viking came out! However it becomes a problem that the software puts the surroundings in as well. It would take a lot of work to trim all the surroundings out. And that is really the only big problem I encountered. I also read online that 3D scanning works best for smaller objects with preferably a lot of detail.
