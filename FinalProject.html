									pThe final project is a group project that is supposed to integrate some of the core subjects, as well as some 2D and 3D elements. The group is also supposed to determine an intellectual proberty licensing. The team consists of a href=httpsaronottars.github.ioFramleidsluferli target=_blankArona, a href= httpsalexanderrobert.github.io target=_blankAlexandera and a href=httpshelgason96.github.ioThorkellHelgason target=_blankÞorkella. The goals of this project are

                                    h2The approachh2
                                    The team decided to use project 4 Make something big and project 5 Molding and casting to supplement this project. In total, those two projects combined should cover the design and manufacture phases of the final project and that way the team is integrating course work into the project.

                                    The group decided in the beginning of the semester to create a modern wine rack. The first question the group wanted answers to was the following Can I store my bottles upside down The answer is Orientation of the bottle makes little difference to the wine’s keeping qualities. That answer was provided by ScienceFocus in this a href= httpswww.sciencefocus.comsciencewhy-is-it-better-to-store-wine-horizontally target=_blankarticlea

                                    br
                                    Then the group went to the world wide web to find inspirations for wine rack designs. After a good meeting discussing different designs, the following design was chosen as an inspiration

                                    In the first two meetings, the group assigned simple tasks to the team members. a href=httpsaronottars.github.ioFramleidsluferli target=_blankArona was in charge of early design drawings of the wine cabinet, a href= httpsalexanderrobert.github.io target=_blankAlexandera set milestones and created a list of more detailed assignments that need to be handed out. a href=httpshelgason96.github.ioThorkellHelgason target=_blankÞorkella started working on the website and documenting the work done already.

                                    To make the design more realistic Aron importing a cad drawing of a wine bottle from grabcad. It can be found a href=httpsgrabcad.comlibrarybottle-of-red-wine-1 target=_blankherea. After importing them into Inventor and making more changes our early design looks like this
